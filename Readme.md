> Web Accesibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web.

When people talk about web accesibility, they talk about making the app accesible for people with disabilties.

### Types of disabilities

- Cognitive and neurological
- Visual

> The web is already accessible, even if your website is not

### Reasons developers should learn accessibility

- It is fun
- We are the ones making it inaccessible
- Human Rights
- Legal Issue
- Reach a larger audience
- Impactful
- Makes you a specialist

### Ways people use the Web

- Keyboard only

- Mouth stick
- Single switch

### Accesibility Standards

Web Content Accesibility Guidelines (WCAG)

WCAG specifies three different conformance levels:

- A (lowest)
- AA (mid range)
- AAA (highest)

> Level A sets a minimum level of accessiblity and does not achieve broad accessibility for many situations. For this reason, University of California recommends AA conformance for all web based information

> WebAIM provides a handy [checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist "WebAIM Checklist") with their recommendations.
